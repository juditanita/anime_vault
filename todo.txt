1. create an action.ts and fetch the data from the url
modify action to return more than the first element from the api
image error since the image is comming from the url needs to be fixed.
load more images when the user reaches the loading "button" for that we use react intersection package and useInview
one the page is load depending on the view notify me so that i can send moreconst { ref, inView } = useInView();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      alert("load More");
    }
  }, [inView]);
