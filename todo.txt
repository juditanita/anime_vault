1. create an action.ts and fetch the data from the url
2.modify action to return more than the first element from the api
3.image error since the image is comming from the url needs to be fixed.
4.load more images when the user reaches the loading "button" for that we use react intersection package and useInview
5.one the page is load depending on the view notify me so that i can send moreconst { ref, inView } = useInView();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      alert("load More");
    }
  }, [inView]);
  6.get more data from the fetch function and set the data as an  AnimeProp from the anime card
  7. add the section from the page.tsx to the loadMore 
  8. as it is loading more and more it's loading the same data. to fix that we need to keep track of the page and increment it.
